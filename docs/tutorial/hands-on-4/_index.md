The goal of this hands-on is to:
* leverage auto-update feature
* boot an old version of Flatcar (stable-3374.2.5 for example)
* provision with ignition from hands-on-2
* control the update

Hint: two services are used:
* `update-engine.service`: to download the update from a release server (Nebraska)
* `locksmithd.service`: to handle the reboot strategy

# Step-by-step

```
# download a previous version of Flatcar and the qemu helper
$ wget https://stable.release.flatcar-linux.net/amd64-usr/3602.2.0/flatcar_production_qemu_image.img
$ wget https://stable.release.flatcar-linux.net/amd64-usr/3602.2.0/flatcar_production_qemu.sh
$ chmod +x flatcar_production_qemu.sh
# boot the instance with the nginx Ignition from a previous lab
$ ./flatcar_production_qemu.sh -i ../hands-on-2/config.json -- -display curses
# assert that `locksmithd.service` and `update-engine` are up and running
$ systemctl status update-engine.service locksmithd.service
# check the release number
$ cat /etc/os-release
# to accelerate the update, we can force it. NOTE: it's not required to do this in "real life" it's just to avoid waiting minutes before downloading the update!
$ update_engine_client -update
# once rebooted
# check the release number
$ cat /etc/os-release
# assert that nginx is still running
$ curl localhost
```
