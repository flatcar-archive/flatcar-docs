`journalctl` is your interface into a single machine's journal/logging. All service files insert data into the systemd journal. There are a few helpful commands to read the journal:

## Read the entire journal

```shell
$ journalctl

-- Logs begin at Fri 2013-12-13 23:43:32 UTC, end at Sun 2013-12-22 12:28:45 UTC. --
Dec 22 00:10:21 localhost systemd-journal[33]: Runtime journal is using 184.0K (max 49.9M, leaving 74.8M of free 499.0M, current limit 49.9M).
Dec 22 00:10:21 localhost systemd-journal[33]: Runtime journal is using 188.0K (max 49.9M, leaving 74.8M of free 499.0M, current limit 49.9M).

## Read entries for a specific service

Read entries generated by a specific unit:

```shell
$ journalctl -u apache.service

-- Logs begin at Fri 2013-12-13 23:43:32 UTC, end at Sun 2013-12-22 12:32:52 UTC. --
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost systemd[1]: Starting Apache Service...
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost systemd[1]: Started Apache Service.
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost docker[9772]: /usr/sbin/apache2ctl: 87: ulimit: error setting limit (Operation not permitted)
Dec 22 12:32:39 localhost docker[9772]: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 172.17.0.6 for ServerName
```

## Read the user journal from the current user

It might be required to add a user different from `core` user to the `systemd-journal` group to read the user journal. It can be done with this Butane config:
```yaml
variant: flatcar
version: 1.0.0
passwd:
  users:
    - name: flatcar
      groups:
        - systemd-journal
```

Then from `flatcar` login: `journalctl --user`.

## Read entries since boot

Reading just the entries since the last boot is an easy way to troubleshoot services that are failing to start properly:

```shell
journalctl --boot
```

## Tail the journal

You can tail the entire journal or just a specific service:

```shell
journalctl -f
```

```shell
journalctl -u apache.service -f
```

## Read entries with line wrapping

By default `journalctl` passes `FRSXMK` command line options to [`less`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/less). You can override these options by setting a custom [`SYSTEMD_LESS`](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journalctl.html#%24SYSTEMD_LESS) environment variable with omitted `S` option:

```shell
SYSTEMD_LESS=FRXMK journalctl
```

Read logs without pager:

```shell
journalctl --no-pager
```

## Debugging journald

If you've faced some problems with journald you can enable debug mode following the instructions below.

### Enable debugging manually

```shell
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/systemd-journald.service.d/
```

Create a [Drop-In][drop-ins] `/etc/systemd/system/systemd-journald.service.d/10-debug.conf` with following content:

```shell
[Service]
Environment=SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

And restart `systemd-journald` service:

```shell
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart systemd-journald
dmesg | grep systemd-journald
```

## Enable debugging via a Butane Config

Define a [Drop-In][drop-ins] in a [Butane Config][butane-configs]:

```yaml
variant: flatcar
version: 1.0.0
systemd:
  units:
    - name: systemd-journald.service
      dropins:
        - name: 10-debug.conf
          contents: |
            [Service]
            Environment=SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

[drop-ins]: ../systemd/drop-in-units
[butane-configs]: ../../provisioning/config-transpiler
