# Running Flatcar Linux on Microsoft Azure

Note that official Flatcar Linux images are not available on Azure at the moment. You can run Flatcar today by

* installing Container Linux (following the official [Container Linux on Azure](https://github.com/coreos/docs/blob/master/os/booting-on-azure.md) and then
* upgrading to Flatcar following the [Update from Container Linux](./flatcar-update-from-container-linux.md).
